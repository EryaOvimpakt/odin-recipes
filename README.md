# odin-recipes

Trying to see what I can manage to do when I'm not following a tutorial.
I am supposed to create a small website consisting of a main landing page and links to some recipes.


Afterthought:
I'm quite happy with how it went. As expected, it's not really pretty but I'll add some pink and some glitter to it once I learn how to use CSS :3
